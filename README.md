  hooks/
    useDocumentTitle.js
    useLenis.jsx       single Lenis instance, driven from the GSAP ticker
    useStallGuard.js   rAF-stall watchdog so content is never trapped hidden
  pages/               Home, Archive, About
  styles/              base.css (shared chrome) + one file per page
```

## Notes

- Every GSAP graph is built inside `gsap.context()` scoped to the page root and
  torn down with `ctx.revert()`, so pinned sections and pin-spacers clean up
  correctly on route change and under React StrictMode's double-mount.
- Lenis is instantiated once at the app level and driven from the GSAP ticker,
  so the smooth-scroll layer and ScrollTrigger never fight over rAF.
- Entrance reveals use `gsap.from` rather than CSS-hidden start states, so the
  copy stays readable if JavaScript never runs.

## Deploying

This is a client-routed SPA. Point your host's rewrite rule at `index.html`
(e.g. Netlify `/* /index.html 200`, or `try_files $uri /index.html` on nginx)
so `/archive` and `/about` resolve on a hard refresh.
